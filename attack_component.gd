#is this the projectile? Should i make a projectile class? what the fuckkkk
#maybe I spawn a projectile, with a collison box, when THAT collides, I use attack_Value

#spawn projectile
#take direction
#take attack_value
#take projectile with those in mind
#projectile goes off into sunset until on hit collision that I think i link to the collision functionality

#I'm gonna code this later I want to get something ont he screen lol
